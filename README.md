# staq
A Stack Exchange question/answer browser for a comandline world.

# Usage
```
staq c ncurses window splitting
```

# Why?
When programming, often I use two tools:
- My terminal
- A browser, open to Stack Overflow to solve problems

It would be ideal to fulfull both of these purposes using a purely console-based interface.

Inspired by `tig`, the excellent git log browser.
