# What
This is a stripped down version of libsoldout, a library for rendering
Markdown to a variety of formats, including the terminal.

Unless I'm mistaken, it lives [here](https://github.com/faelys/libsoldout).

The provided documentation is quite good, and I recommend using it.

# So What's This Then?
For my purposes, I didn't need all the things included in the full repo. So
I stripped out what I did need and included it here with a customized makefile.
